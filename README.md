- ⚡ Fun fact: 
Modern airplanes are marvels of engineering, and a big part of that marvel is their reliance on sophisticated software! These high-tech systems manage everything from critical flight controls and navigation to engine performance, ensuring a smooth and safe journey. Pilots also use special four-digit codes, known as squawk codes, to communicate important information with air traffic control. These codes can indicate the flight's intentions or even signal emergencies. So, next time you’re soaring through the skies, remember the invisible, intricate code that's hard at work behind the scenes, making your flight possible and safe! ✈️✨
