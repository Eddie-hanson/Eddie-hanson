- ⚡ Fun fact: Here's a fun fact that combines flying, pilots, and coding:

Modern airplanes are incredibly reliant on code!  While pilots are still very much in control, critical flight systems, navigation, and even engine controls are all managed by complex software. In fact, pilots actually use special codes, called squawk codes, to communicate with air traffic control. These codes are four-digit numbers that identify the aircraft and can be used to transmit information about the flight's intentions or even emergencies.  So, next time you fly,  think about all the code silently working behind the scenes to keep you soaring through the sky!
